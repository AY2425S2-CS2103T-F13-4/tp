**ClassHive is a desktop application for teachers managing the contact information of people they meet in school.** 
Most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface), even though it also has a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* Want to get started on using ClassHive? Head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* The [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) contains all the necessary information for developing ClassHive.
